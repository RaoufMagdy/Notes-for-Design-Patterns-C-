/**
 * \brief Why do we need a Builder?: - Builder is used when an "object" requires multiple steps or parameters to be properly initialized.
 *                                   - Builder aims to solve the problem of complex object construction by separating the construction process from the object representation.
 *                                   - Builder provides an API for constructing an object step by step.
